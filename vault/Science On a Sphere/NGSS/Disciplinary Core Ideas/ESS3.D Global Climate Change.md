 - Human activities, such as the release of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, are major factors in the current rise in Earthâ€™s mean surface temperature (global warming). Reducing the level of climate change and reducing human vulnerability to whatever climate changes do occur depend on the understanding of climate science, engineering capabilities, and other kinds of knowledge, such as understanding of human behavior and on applying that knowledge wisely in decisions and activities.
