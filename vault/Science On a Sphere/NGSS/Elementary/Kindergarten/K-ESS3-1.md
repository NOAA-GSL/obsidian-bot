Use a model to represent the relationship between the needs of different plants or animals (including humans) and the places they live. 

**Clarification Statement:** Examples of relationships could include that deer eat buds and leaves, therefore, they usually live in forested areas, and grasses need sunlight so they often grow in meadows. Plants, animals, and their surroundings make up a system.
