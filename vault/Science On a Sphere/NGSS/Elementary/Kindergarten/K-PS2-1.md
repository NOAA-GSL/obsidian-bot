Plan and conduct an investigation to compare the effects of different strengths or different directions of pushes and pulls on the motion of an object. 

**Clarification Statement:** Examples of pushes or pulls could include a string attached to an object being pulled, a person pushing an object, a person stopping a rolling ball, and two objects colliding and pushing on each other.

**Assessment Boundary:** Assessment is limited to different relative strengths or different directions, but not both at the same time. Assessment does not include non-contact pushes or pulls such as those produced by magnets.
