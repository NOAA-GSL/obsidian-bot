Analyze data to determine if a design solution works as intended to change the speed or direction of an object with a push or a pull.*

**Clarification Statement**: Examples of problems requiring a solution could include having a marble or other object move a certain distance, follow a particular path, and knock down other objects. Examples of solutions could include tools such as a ramp to increase the speed of the object and a structure that would cause an object such as a marble or ball to turn.

**Assessment Boundary:** Assessment does not include friction as a mechanism for change in speed.
