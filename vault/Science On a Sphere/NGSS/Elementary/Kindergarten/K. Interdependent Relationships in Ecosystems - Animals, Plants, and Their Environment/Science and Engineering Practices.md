**Developing and Using Models**
Modeling in K–2 builds on prior experiences and progresses to include using and developing models (i.e., diagram, drawing, physical replica, diorama, dramatization, or storyboard) that represent concrete events or design solutions.
- Use a model to represent relationships in the natural world. (K-ESS3-1)

**Analyzing and Interpreting Data**
Analyzing data in K–2 builds on prior experiences and progresses to collecting, recording, and sharing observations.
- Use observations (firsthand or from media) to describe patterns in the natural world in order to answer scientific questions. (K-LS1-1)

**Engaging in Argument from Evidence**
Engaging in argument from evidence in K–2 builds on prior experiences and progresses to comparing ideas and representations about the natural and designed world(s).
- Construct an argument with evidence to support a claim. (K-ESS2-2)

**Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information**
Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information in K– 2 builds on prior experiences and uses observations and texts to communicate new information.
- Communicate solutions with others in oral and/or written forms using models and/or drawings that provide detail about scientific ideas. (K-ESS3-3)

**Connections to Nature of Science**
Scientific Knowledge is Based on Empirical Evidence
- Scientists look for patterns and order when making observations about the world. (K-LS1-1)
