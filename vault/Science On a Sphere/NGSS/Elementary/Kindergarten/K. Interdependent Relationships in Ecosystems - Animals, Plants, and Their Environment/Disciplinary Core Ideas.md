Organisms
▪ All animals need food in order to live and grow. They obtain
their food from plants or from other animals. Plants need water
and light to live and grow. (K-LS1- 1 )
ESS2.E: Biogeology
▪ Plants and animals can change their environment. (K-ESS2- 2 )
ESS3.A: Natural Resources
▪ Living things need water, air, and resources from the land, and
they live in places that have the things they need. Humans use
natural resources for everything they do. (K-ESS3- 1 )
ESS3.C: Human Impacts on Earth Systems

around them. But they can make choices that reduce their
impacts on the land, water, air, and other living things.
