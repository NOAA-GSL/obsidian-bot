The performance expectations above were developed using the following elements from the NRC document A Framework for K-12 Science Education:

![[NGSS/Elementary/Kindergarten/K. Forces and Interactions - Pushes and Pulls/Science and Engineering Practices]]

![[NGSS/Elementary/Kindergarten/K. Forces and Interactions - Pushes and Pulls/Disciplinary Core Ideas]]

#### Connections to other DCIs in kindergarten: 
**K.ETS1.A** ([[K-PS2-2]]); **K.ETS1.B** ([[K-PS2-2]])
#### Articulation of DCIs across grade-levels:
**2.ETS1.B** ([[K-PS2-2]]); **3.PS2.A** ([[K-PS2-1]]),([[K-PS2- 2]]); **3.PS2.B** ([[K-PS2-1]]); **4 .PS 3 .A** ([[K-PS2-1]]); **4.ETS1.A** ([[K-PS2-2]])
#### Common Core State Standards Connections:

ELA/Literacy –
**RI.K.1** With prompting and support, ask and answer questions about key details in a text. ([[K-PS2-2]])
**W.K.7** Participate in shared research and writing projects (e.g., explore a number of books by a favorite author and express opinions about them). ([[K-PS2-1]])
**SL.K.3** Ask and answer questions in order to seek help, get information, or clarify something that is not understood. ([[K-PS2-2]])

Mathematics –
**MP.2** Reason abstractly and quantitatively. ([[K-PS2-1]])
**K.MD.A. 1** Describe measurable attributes of objects, such as length or weight. Describe several measurable attributes of a single object. ([[K-PS2-1]])
**K.MD.A. 2** Directly compare two objects with a measurable attribute in common, to see which object has “more of”/”less of” the attribute, and describe the difference. ([[K-PS2-1]])
