## International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship

The International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship ([IBTrACS](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-best-track-archive)) project is the most complete global collection of tropical cyclones available. It merges recent and historical tropical cyclone data from multiple agencies to create a unified, publicly available, best-track dataset that improves inter-agency comparisons. IBTrACS was developed collaboratively with all the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres, as well as other organizations and individuals from around the world. The technical documentation can be found [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/IBTrACS_version4_Technical_Details.pdf).
## Historical Hurricane Tracks

This [feature layer](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d053e72aabfd4c5ab4139c3829c1e11c), utilizing data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), displays hurricane tracks from 1842-2022. According to [NOAA](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/hurricane.html), "a tropical cyclone is a rotating low-pressure weather system that has organized thunderstorms but no fronts (a boundary separating two air masses of different densities). Tropical cyclones with maximum sustained surface winds of less than 39 miles per hour (mph) are called tropical depressions. Those with maximum sustained winds of 39 mph or higher are called tropical storms. When a storm's maximum sustained winds reach 74 mph, it is called a hurricane.

Attached is a [geojson](https://geojson.org/) file containing the same information as the ArcGIS feature layer.
