The NGSS standards that the hurricane tracks dataset satisfy are:

1. **[[MS-ESS2-5]]:** Collect data to provide evidence for how the motions and complex interactions of air masses result in changes in weather conditions.
2. **[[HS-ESS2-4]]:** Use a model to describe how variations in the flow of energy into and out of Earthâ€™s systems result in changes in climate.
3. **[[MS-ESS3-2]]:** Analyze and interpret data on natural hazards to forecast future catastrophic events and inform the development of technologies to mitigate their effects.
