## Hurricane Tracks: Cumulative - 1950 - 2020

This [cutout globe](https://sos.noaa.gov/education/paper-globe-cutouts/#hurricane-tracks:-cumulative-1950-2020) shows the paths of significant storms from 1950 through 2020. Each line represents a tropical depression or tropical storm (blue or cyan) or a hurricane (yellow to red). Not all the storms follow the same path, but there are noticeable trends. The maximum sustained wind speeds are shown in the legend. Tracking historical storms is an important way for researchers to help forecast future events.
