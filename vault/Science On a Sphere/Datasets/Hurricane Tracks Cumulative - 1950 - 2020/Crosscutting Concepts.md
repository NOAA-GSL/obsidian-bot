The crosscutting concepts that the hurricane tracks dataset satisfies are:

1. **[[Cause and Effect]]:** The dataset shows the paths of all tropical cyclones from 1950 through 2020, indicating patterns in cyclone paths and how they are influenced by various factors like wind shear patterns, maximum sustained wind speeds, and the starting points of cyclones.

2. **[[Patterns]]:** By displaying the historical paths of hurricanes, the dataset allows for the observation of patterns in how hurricanes move, where they start, and how they progress over time. This helps in identifying trends and patterns in cyclone behavior.
