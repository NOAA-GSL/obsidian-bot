# obsidian-bot

Obsidian-bot is an innovative project that bridges the power of Obsidian, a popular knowledge management tool, with the capabilities of LangChain, a library designed to integrate language models into applications seamlessly. This Python-based script utilizes an Obsidian vault to serve as a dynamic and rich knowledge base for training and retrieving information using AI.

## Features

* Knowledge-Powered Bot: Utilizes the structured and unstructured data within an Obsidian vault to answer queries, making it a potent tool for information retrieval and decision support.
* AI-Driven Insights: Employs LangChain to leverage state-of-the-art language models, ensuring high-quality, context-aware responses based on the contents of the Obsidian vault.
* Modular Design: Designed with a focus on modularity and easy integration, allowing users to extend or modify the bot as per their specific needs.
* Open Source: Encourages community involvement and contributions, making the bot adaptable and versatile to various use cases.

## Use Cases

* Personal Knowledge Management: Enhance personal information management by enabling quick retrieval of notes and documented thoughts via conversational AI.
* Research Assistance: Aid researchers by providing swift access to a consolidated base of notes and references.
* Educational Tool: Serve as an educational resource, facilitating learning and revision through interactive Q&A sessions based on stored educational content.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, set up the environment with the required dependencies, and follow the setup instructions to get your own instance of the bot running with your Obsidian vault.
